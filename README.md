# Prim-s-algorithm
Prim's algorithm implementation in R.
<hr/>
<p>"Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex." - Wikip√©dia. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)</p>
<p>The code have been tested, and approved, with the 17 graphs in the /Graphs folder. Inside the code file there are comments(in pt-br) explaining the algorithm proccess.</p>
